Can you start me a simple react app that uses typescript and tailwindcss. Set it up so that it's easy to change the theme. The theme should be minimal and clean (similar to instapaper). The app will have the logo in the top-left, and 3 screens. The first is the Search / Add Seeds screen. It should have a centered search bar with a toggle to switch between "Search" and "Seed" modes. The color of the border should be different for each mode. There also needs to be a button that says "search" or "seed" that users will click to execute the action. The second screen is the search screen, which is a simple list of content resources (ex. blog posts), each will have a title, date, reading length, and first paragraph or so of the article/resource. The final page is the graph screen, where a graph of content is stored (ex. blog 1 links to blog 2 and blog 3). Certain nodes should be able to be color-coded and each node should correspond to a single content resource. Use mock json data to store the graph and search results list.
